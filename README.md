This project is of Facebook's login/signup page's clone. It aims to replicate the basic functionality and design elements of Facebook's interface using HTML and CSS.

## Technologies Used
HTML: Used for structuring the page content. <br>
CSS: Used for styling and layout design. <br>
Font Awesome: Utilized for icons such as the Facebook logo. <br>

### HTML Structure:
The HTML provides the structure for a simplified version of Facebook's login/signup page. <br>
It includes elements such as containers, logos, input fields for email and password, login button, forgotten password link, and a link to create a new account. <br>
A footer section is added with language options and various links related to Facebook services and policies. <br>

### CSS Styling:
CSS styles are applied to elements to define their appearance and layout. <br>
Styles define the background color, font, size, and other visual aspects of the page elements. <br>
Selectors like .container, .left-content, .card, .login-btn, .Forgotten-password, .create-new-account, .create-a-page, .f-lg-footer, ul, li, a, and p are used to target specific elements and apply styling rules. <br>
Box shadow and border radius properties are used to give the card element a visually appealing look. <br>
Input fields and buttons have specific styling to enhance their appearance and usability. <br>
